# Algorithms and Data Structures

Each implementation module includes at least two things

1) Implementation binded to an identifier
  - For algorithms, identifier is `algorithm`
  - For data structures, identifier is `structure`
  - For project euler, identifier is `solution`

2) A name that identifies the implementation.

This is the expected module interface for interoperability, including
unit testing.
