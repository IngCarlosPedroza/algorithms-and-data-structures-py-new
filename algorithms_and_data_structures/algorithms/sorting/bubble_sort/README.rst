Bubble Sort
==============

Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if
they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the
list is sorted.

Time Complexity
---------------

- Best: `O(n)`
- Worst: `O(n^2)`
- Average: `O(n^2)`

Space Complexity
----------------

- Total: `O(n)`
- Auxiliary: `O(1)`
